        <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Jesse, I became a full-time UX designer in 2014. Prior to becoming a UX designer I wore many different hats at a small agency. It was here I got my first taste of UX design and completely immersed myself into the field. I had the opportunity to design complete experiences for mobile apps and responsive websites but I was curious to learning more about how the development team worked. I left my agency job to take a full-time web development course. After finishing the course I joined a SaSS company as a full-time user experience professional.</p>
