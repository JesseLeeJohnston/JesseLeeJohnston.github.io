        <p>It was August of 2014 and I had left my last job 3 months earlier. In my time off I took a coding course and time to relax and recharge. I was heading up to Whistler to go for a nice summer hike on a Wednesday morning, something I wasn’t able to do while working the classic Monday to Friday 9-5 gig. I knew I had to make the most of these opportunities while I had the chance because I knew I wouldn’t get another until I took a vacation from the company I would wind up working for next. </p>
        <p>Turns out that company called me that day while I was enjoying the amazing hiking and scenery the Whistler mountains have to offer. They wanted me to come in for an interview at 9am the very next day.</p>

        <p>Now I realize you’re browsing my website and expecting this to be a portfolio showcase of the work I’ve done for ResponseTek. However when I was hired by the company I signed an NDA agreement which means I cannot share with you the projects I’m working on or have worked on. However it doesn’t stop me from explaining my journey at the company and sharing with some of what I’ve learned and continue to learn during my time there.</p>

        <p>Lets get back to that wonderful August of 2014. At this point I had interviewed with a couple of different companies. I had some great interviews that I thought went amazingly but never heard back. I had some interviews I was unprepared for and didn’t succeed in. When I interviewed at ResponseTek I honestly thought it couldn’t have gone any worse. It was the only interview I had done where I was completely convinced that I had done so poorly they would never contact me again. I was probably just being hard on myself. However would’t you know it they called me the very next day with an offer.</p>

        <h2>Thus my ResponseTek journey begins. </h2>
        <p>I came in on my first day eager to make some changes as anyone does at a new place of work. I was excited to design for a Software company, all my other jobs had been for Marketing agencies. I got to try their applications and learn about the Voice of Customer program. The first day turned into the first week and there was so much to learn. What was NPS? What was CSAT? what does a enterprise hierarchy look like?</p>

        <h2>Bridge the Divide</h2>
        <p>I wanted to create change at ResponseTek. When I came into the company I realized there was a disconnect between the client facing teams and the engineering teams. I wanted to bridge that gap and get people talking the same language. I found that when product and development would start talking about features they wouldn’t have the best intentions of the user in mind. I Would hear things such as “What’s the fastest way you can build that”, “That’s ok, just put it under that section they’ll find it”. They weren’t thinking about who they were building for they were just trying to get it done. This got me started on creating some personas for the team to work from, some real people they could reference and build for. No longer were they building for faceless “users” they were building for Tom from Safeco that manages a team of field agents or Grabriella at T-Mobile that manages the CX research which reports to the C-Suite. When their mindset started to change to be more user focused so did the products they were building.</p>

        <h2>Beautiful Data</h2>
        <p>One of my favourite things to work on at Responsetek have been the dashboards we produce. We recently embarked on creating a new reporting framework that uses some of the coolest data visualization libraries (D3.js). Our clients have been coming to us for increasingly complicated metrics and datasets they’ve wanted to be able to track and measure. With our new framework we’ve been able to create some exciting visualizations that are starting to help separate us from the pack. Building this framework was extremely exciting for me as I got to start fresh, no more dealing with legacy browsers or code. No more hearing the developers say “We can’t do that because…”. It was a blank canvas, one that could really help bring us to the forefront of great designed products. We worked in an extremely agile format on 1 week sprints. Testing was on the fly and changes had to be made quick. As of right now we have a framework we can really bring data to life with and as a result delight our clients.  </p>

        <p>So far over the course of my time there I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of work and being the only UX designer has given me a chance to figure out what I like and don’t like to do and really start to focus in on what I’m good at.</p>
        <p>The story is continuing to evolve and I hope you’ve enjoyed reading this so far.</p>
