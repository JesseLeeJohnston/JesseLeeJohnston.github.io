        <p>In July of 2014 CodeCore Bootcamp and The Next Big Thing teamed up to provide high school students with an opportunity to learn about web development. We wanted to make this experience something these students could remember and offer them a way of showing their friends and family what theyâ€™ve learned.</p>

        <p>This project was a great way for everyone on the team to learn the ins and outs of version control using GitHub. As a team we also gave each other good feedback to make this project as best as possible. </p>
        <p>Our job was to create a web application that allowed the students to uploaded their newly created websites by simply dragging and dropping them into the screen. This idea came from our instructor Tam Kbeili and we executed it.</p>
