        <p>TikTok was a mobile application that provided customers with geo-targeted deals. When customers were in a certain area they would be able to open their application and see deals within the immediate area. Retailers were able to post deals for free unlike their competitors.</p>

        <p>Our client was a software startup that only had an idea when they approached us. It was my job to plan the user experience from initial application alert, to the customer redeeming their deal in store.</p>  
        <p>Many different types of variables had to be taken into consideration. What if there were no deals? What happens when the deal expires? These are all questions that were answered in the wireframing stage.</p>

        <p>The application was not the only part of the user experience design. The businesses also were able to use the backend and login to post a deal of their own. This also gave them access to analytics and other details about their deals.</p>
        <p>The application was made for both the iPhone and Andriod OS. Unfortunately TikTok is no longer an active company. That's what happens in the start up world.</p>
