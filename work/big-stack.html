    <h1>Big Stack - Online ordering for a food truck</h1>
    <div class="grid">
      <div class="col-1-1">
        <p>This is a test project I worked on to help give my portfolio some more consumer facing breadth. I also wanted to help give an insight into my process without discussing private information of the companies I work for.</p>
        <p><strong>Big Stack background</strong></p>
        <p>Big Stack, a food truck company wants to generate more business through their online website. They've noticed that the line-ups outside the trucks are getting so long that they're starting to lose customers. To address this, the company wants to build on their website and create a system where customers can place their order online, then pick it up and pay at the food truck.</p>

        <p>When I started tackling this project I began by drawing out some user flows and making a list of the different screens a user would need to see. During my brainstorming I began to think of the process for taking orders inside of the truck, there would have to be an easy system to track and complete orders from inside. I initially created two different user flows. The first user flow is that of the customer placing a simple order. The second is that of the food truck employee receiving the order and completing it. As I worked further on this project I began to explore more use cases but this portfolio piece focuses on the customer facing product.</p>

        <h3>Wireframing my ideas</h3>
        <p>At the beginning of the project I was trying to get everything onto one page as I had a theory, it might make the ordering process easier. It also helped that the food truck didn't have many options. However the more I explored this route the more I learned that seperate pages would create an easier experience for the end user, it also allowed the food truck to grow its food options in future.</p>

        <h3>Working with higher fidelity</h3>
        <p>As I started to work in higher fidelity I had to work with the existing logo of Big Stack. I tried to make sure that when a customer visited this ordering application it felt similar to the main corporate website and the branding they saw when visiting the food truck. The product photos I used are just place holders, the client would need to have professional photos taken of their products that use consistent lighting and angles.</p>

          <h3>Animation</h3>
          <p>I used Flinto to prototype the animations. Flinto is a really great program that helps me design exactly how I want something to work before itâ€™s actually built. It allows me to push the boundaries of web and app animation and produce something that looks very slick.</p>
